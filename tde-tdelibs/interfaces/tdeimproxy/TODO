For the future, the following modifications need to be done:

Currently there is a function :
  virtual TQString presenceString( const TQString & uid ) = 0;
This needs to be broken into:
  virtual TQString presenceString( const TQString & uid ) = 0;
  virtual TQString presenceLongString( const TQString & uid ) = 0;

The former returning, say "Away", the latter returning the long away
message.
