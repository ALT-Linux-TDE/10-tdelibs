-This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
-published from being rewound.
-
-The workflow assumed here is:
-
- * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
-   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
-
- * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
-   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
-   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
-   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
-   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
-
- * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
-   branches, merge them into "next" branch.
-
-The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
-to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
-$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
-
-With this workflow, you would want to know:
-
-(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
-    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
-    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
-    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
-    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
-    not want to rewind it.
-
-(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
-    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
-    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
-    change things related to the topic as patches against your
-    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
-    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
-    tip of "master".
-
-Let's look at this example:
-
-		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
-		  /       /           /           /
-		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
-		/   /               /           /
-	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
-	      /   /   /             \         /
-	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
-	    /   /   /   /             \     /
-    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
-
-
-A, B and C are topic branches.
-
- * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
-
- * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
-   and is ready to be deleted.
-
- * C has not merged to "next" at all.
-
-We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
-B to be deleted.
-
-To compute (1):
-
-	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
-	git rev-list ^master        next
-
-	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
-
-To compute (2):
-
-	git rev-list master..topic
-
-	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

-# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
-#
-# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
-# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
-# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
-# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
-# updateInstead.
-#
-# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
-# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
-# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
-# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
-# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
-# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
-# as a starting point for convenient modification.
-#
-# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
-# branch is going to be updated:
-commit=$1
-
-# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
-# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
-die () {
-	echo >&2 "$*"
-	exit 1
-}
-
-# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
-# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
-# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
-#
-# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
-# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
-# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
-# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
-# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
-# not interfere with the difference between the branches.
-
-# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
-# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
-# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
-#
-# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
-# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
-# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
-# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.
